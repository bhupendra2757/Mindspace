              Who are we?
            </Typography>
            MindSpace is a hackathon project started by a group of 5 individuals, who are motivated to solve the real-world problem of this world with the help of technology. Other than being just a hackathon project, we have realized that this project can go to the real world and help people improve their mental health.

              What we do?
            </Typography>
            At MindSpace, we aim to be the platform for people dealing with mental health issues, which are becoming increasingly common.<br />
            Regardless of whether you're anxious, depressed, or suffering from any other mental illness, we aim to become your go-to place.<br />
            Dedicated to becoming the leading place for people suffering from mental illness, MindSpace has the vision to become the place where people come to get help.<br />
            We hope to spread awareness about mental illness and why people should approach it as they would any other health problem.

              How we work?
            </Typography>
            MindSpace allows users to know themself and realize what they are going through just by answering some of the questions asked by the system. Additionally, we offer users the opportunity to speak to someone who has already recovered from a mental illness aka "Ghost Person" since they are completely anonymous. Last but not least, we help users find and book doctors based on their needs.
